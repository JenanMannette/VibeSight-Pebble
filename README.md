## Smartstrap for the Pebble Time

Those affected with severe vision problems can often be hindered by the need for a blind cane.  Our smartstrap can change that.

We are new to hardware, so when we were offered the chance to work with Arduino boards and proximity sensors, we were excited to be able to address a real problem with an achievable solution.  

Utilizing a Pebble Watch, a Teensy 3.1 Arduino board, and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic proximity sensor, we aim to create an application that detects the world around it using SONAR, and warn its wearer with a vibration when they approach a large object in their path.
